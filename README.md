# CS-674
My projects in [CS 674: Data Mining on Multimedia Data](http://cs.gmu.edu/~jessica/cs674_s17.html) at Mason, Spring 2017. This class was taught by Jessica Lin, PhD. Each homeowork folder contains the assignment instructions in a .pdf.

## Assignments
Homework 1: For time series data, implement 1-NN and _k_-NN with Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW should include both the base version and with a warping window constraint _w_.

Homework 2: Use time series motif discovery for classification.

Homework 3: Presented the following paper on location-based social networks to my class: Cho, E., Myers, S. A., & Leskovec, J. (2011, August). Friendship and mobility: user movement in location-based social networks. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (pp. 1082-1090). ACM.

Homework 4: Using LDA for topic modeling on a text dataset and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

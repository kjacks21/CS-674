My projects in [CS 674: Data Mining on Multimedia Data](http://cs.gmu.edu/~jessica/cs674_s17.html) at Mason, Spring 2017. This class was taught by Jessica Lin, PhD. Each homeowork folder contains the assignment instructions in a .pdf.

## Assignments
Homework 1: For time series data, implement 1-NN and _k_-NN with Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW should include both the base version and with a warping window constraint _w_.

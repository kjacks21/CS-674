# To run:

kNN.py in src folder contains all code for nearest neighbor algorithm and distance measures. You may run in console, but it is preferable to use Spyder (or other text editor) and run in chunks that are delimited by #%%.

The first chunk of kNN.py contains functions used to construct a kNN classifier. The later chunks were used for evaluation.
